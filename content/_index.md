title: "MOLB 7950: Informatics and Statistics for Molecular Biology"
description: >
    A hands-on tutorial of skills and theory needed to process, analyze, and
    visualize output from large biological data sets. We emphasize command-line
    tools, Python programming, and the R statistical computing environment.

## Course Overview 

MOLB 7950 teaches bioinforamtic skills and theory needed to process large
biological data sets.

Classes will be held via zoom and recorded using Panopto. Real-time help will be
provided via zoom breakout rooms.

See the [syllabus] for dates and times.

The course is divided into 4 blocks:

THe **Bootcamp block** covers the basics of shell, R, and Python programming. We
will meet everyday for 1 hour to cover fundamental concepts you will need
throughout the course.

After Bootcamp, will cover experimental approaches used to analyze DNA, RNA, and
protein. Each block will begin with statistical concepts needed for rigorous
analysis.

1. The **DNA block** covers genome sequencing for identifying mutations, and two
approaches for analyzing chromatin state (ChIP-seq and MNase-seq).

1. The **RNA block** covers RNA-seq, alternative splicing, differential gene
expression, and RNA:protein interactions.

1. The **Protein block** covers mass spectrometry, densitometry, and image
analysis.

## Assignments and grading

The course measures learning through daily problem sets (graded by your peers),
block exams, a final project, and your participation.

| **Type**     | **% of grade** |
| :----         | :----:           |
| Problem Sets | 30             |
| Block Exams  | 30             |
| Final Proejct| 20             |
| Particpation | 20             |

### Problem sets 

We reinforce concepts with problem sets assigned at the end of class on Mon and
Wed that should take ~30 minutes to complete. Problems sets assigned on Friday
will be more subsantial, requiring ~2 hours to complete. Together the problem
sets constitute 30% of your grade.

Problem sets on Mon and Wed will be graded by your peers, randomly assigning
two anonymous reviewers for each assignment, and are double-blinded. Peer
grading is an effective tool that enables you to learn from each other and
critically evalute others' code and approaches. **Your peer grading work counts as 
50% of your participation grade**.

| **Assigned** | **Due** | **Grades By** | **Who grades** | **Time to complete (approx)** |
| ----         | ----    | ----           | ----         | ----              |
| Mon @ 12pm   | Tues @ 12pm | Wed @ 12pm  | Peer-graded | 30 min |
| Wed @ 12pm   | Thurs @ 12pm | Fri @ 12pm | Peer-graded | 30 min |
| Fri @ 12pm   | Mon @ 5pm | Wed @ 5pm  | Instructors / TAs | 1-2 hr |

### Block exams

Block exams will be assigned at the end of the Bootcamp, DNA, RNA, and protein
blocks and should take 3-4 hours to complete. These will be graded by Instructors / TAs and together the exams contsitute 30% of your grade.

### Final projects

Final projects can be completed in groups of 1-3 people. Projects will involve
analysis of existing public data sets and end with a short presentation the 
last week of class. The final project constitutes 20% of your grade.
