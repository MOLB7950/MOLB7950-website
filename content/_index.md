    This course a hands-on tutorial of skills and theory needed to process large
    biological data sets and visualize their results. We emphasize command-line
    tools, Python programming, and the R statistical computing environment.

## Course Overview 

MOLB 7950 teaches bioinforamtic skills and theory needed to process large
biological data sets.

Classes will be held via zoom and recorded using Panopto. Real-time help will be
provided via zoom breakout rooms.

See the [syllabus] for dates and times.

The course is divided into 4 blocks:

THe **Bootcamp block** covers the basics of shell, R, and Python programming. We
will meet everyday for 1 hour to cover fundamental concepts you will need
throughout the course.

After Bootcamp, will cover experimental approaches used to analyze DNA, RNA, and
protein. Each block will begin with statistical concepts needed for rigorous
analysis.

1. The **DNA block** covers genome sequencing for identifying mutations, and two
approaches for analyzing chromatin state (ChIP-seq and MNase-seq).

1. The **RNA block** covers RNA-seq, alternative splicing, differential gene
expression, and RNA:protein interactions.

1. The **Protein block** covers mass spectrometry, densitometry, and image
analysis.

## Assignments and grading

The course measures learning through daily problem sets (graded by your peers),
block exams, a final project, and your participation.

| **Type**     | **% of grade** |
| :----         | :----:           |
| Problem Sets | 35             |
| Block Exams  | 35             |
| Final Proejct| 20             |
| Particpation | 10             |

### Problem sets 

We reinforce concepts with problem sets assigned at the end of each class
that should typically take ~30 minutes to complete. Together the problem sets
constitute 25% of your grade.

Problem sets will be graded by your peers, randomly assigning two anonymous
reviewers for each assignment. Peer grading is an effective tool that enables
you to learn from each other and critically evalute others' code and approaches.
Your peer grading work will factor into your overall participation grade.

### Block exams

Block exams will be assigned at the end of the Bootcamp, DNA, RNA, and protein
blocks and should take a few hours to complete. Together the exams contsitute
35% of your grade.

### Final projects

Final projects can be complete in groups of 1-3 people. Projects will involve
analysis of existing public data sets and end with a short presentation the 
last week of class. The final project constitutes 20% of your grade.
