## Policies

### Diversity & Inclusiveness

Our view is that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be
well-served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed both in
and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class
s a resource, strength, and benefit.

### Disability Policy

Students with disabilities who need accommodations are encouraged to contact the
[Office of Disability Resources and
Services](http://www.ucdenver.edu/student-services/resources/disability-resources-services/CU%20ANSCHUTZ%20MEDICAL%20CAMPUS/Pages/default.aspx)
as soon as possible to better ensure that such accommodations are implemented in
a timely fashion.

## How to get help

### Discussion

Course discussion will be through the slack molb7950 organization.

Guidelines for using Slack:

* Use the dedicated channels for discussion in `#class`, questions about your
`#problem-sets`, and your `#final-project`

* You can ask for help by tagging the TAs in the `#class` channel. If you post `@ta help`, someone
will start a thread where you can ask a question.

* If needed, we can talk face-to-face via the `/zoom` integration.

### Office Hours 

* Our TAs will host study sessions on Thursday afternoons from 12-5pm.

### Honor code

**Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated.** For other information, please consult the [Graduate Student Handbook](http://catalog.ucdenver.edu/mime/media/23/1141/Consolidated+Handbook.pdf).

### Course components

#### Pre-requisites

You will need to complete three pre-requisites before the relevant section of the bootcamp starts:

1. Introduction to R (before week 2 of bootcamp)
2. Introduction to the tidyverse (before week 2 of bootcamp)
3. Introduction to Python (before week 3 of bootcamp)

These should be listed under the Assignemnts in your Datacamp workspace.

#### Problem Sets

* Problem sets will be assigned periodically, usually on MWF.

* Class attendance in lecture and lab is a firm expectation; frequent absences or
tardiness will be considered a legitimate cause for grade reduction.

* You can use these resources but **must explicitly cite** where you have
obtained code (both code you used directly and "paraphrased" code / code used as
inspiration). Any reused code that is not explicitly cited will be treated as
plagiarism.

* You can discuss the content of assignments with others in this class. If
you do so, please acknowledge your collaborator(s) at the top of your
assignment, for example: "Collaborators: Hillary and Bernie". Failure to acknowledge collaborators will result in a grade of 0. You
**may not** copy code and/or answers **directly** from another student. If you
copy someone else's work, both parties will receive a grade of 0.

* Homework with the lowest score for each student will be dropped.

* Rather than copying someone else's work, ask for help. You are not alone in
this course!

### Late / missed work

* Late work policy for homework assignments and labs:

    - Late, but within 24 hours of due date/time: -50%
    - Any later: no credit
    
* All regrade requests must be discussed with the professor within one week of
receiving your grade. There will be no grade changes after the final project.

### Professionalism

- Please refrain from texting or using your computer for anything other than
coursework during class.
